ResNet-110 on CIFAR-10) a high learning rate can slow down the convergence at the beginning of the training (eg. the accuracy remain at chance level for several epochs). **This is usually a symptom of poor initialization**: a way to counteract this is to **use a lower learning rate for a few epochs** until accuracy increases. <br>\n",

    "The previous method works well. However we have to train a lot of networks and this could take a lot of time. To counteract this issue, **snapshot ensembling** comes to aid.\n",
    "By using a **cyclic learning rate schedule**, we can simulate $M$ trainings in the time span of one by taking **snapshots of the parameters** reached at the end of each cycle. <br>\n",
    "We can use a *cyclic cosine learning rate* which will look like this:\n",
    "<img src=\"img/cosine_cyclic.jpg\">\n",
    "\n",
    "So, whenever the this cyclic cosine learnig rate is deacreased, we take a snapshots of the parameter of the model and we save this model. The proceed in doing this until the training has finished. At the end we will end up with $M$ models. By ensembling those models at test time, we usually gain better performance that just doing one cycle of training."

    "If we do not want to pay the price of the ensemble at test time (because at runtime we would need to run $M$ models), **we would want to get the benefit ensemble without running ensembles**. How to do so? <br>\n",
    "One thing we can do is **Polyak average** which is basically the idea of updating the parameter in the same way we are doing so far but **then we keep another copy of them**  ($\\theta^{(test)}$) where we accumulate every new version of our parameter which we have in a running average fashion. So actually the parameters used at test time will be a running average of the parameter we have seen at training time. **Why this is a good idea?** Because we will see that the loss will be super noisy. It will bumbs a lot between different minibatches. So this Polyak average of the parameters is actually taking the mean of the crazy movement of the loss and on average will give us better performance than one of these checkpoints alone."

    "A variation of Polyak average is the so called **Stochastic Weight Averaging**.\n",
    "Its idea is to combine the multiple annealing (eg. the downside curve of the cyclical learning rate). We take only the snapshots when the learning rate in the downside ad small and, instead of doing an ensemble of that, **we average these weights like we did in Polyak average**, but instead of doing it for all the parameters as Polyak does, we **average** only the good ones (the one where the learning rate is already decreased and so it could have reached a good minima or something like a minima). This shown that it generalize well."
